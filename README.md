# NFL-Big-Data-Bowl-2026
Team project for predictive analytics. 

Project links and deadlines: 

[nfl-big-data-bowl-2026-analytics](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-big-data-bowl-2026-analytics) December 17 submission deadline

 ## Ideas of relationships to predict player movement
- type of play
- most common formations
- top routes
- interaction of location on the field and score to where they will be
- zone coverage is more than man coverage so add that to the model with defensive players
- based off of position and O/D it would help (then orientation and direction would help us know where offense will go since defense is more predictable with coverage)

## Vision of professors 
- for predictive competition, dr page want to throw a neural net at the data first and see what we come up with then feature engineer (edit interactions and explanatory variables) from there to predict better
- i ran a random forest but after 11 hours of running i quit it, so i'll try something else lol

## What we need done now
- fully explore the data (EDA and play by play animations for specific week or team to understand player movement details in relation to our variables)
  - focus on coverage for defense, offense, and position
  - include geospatial sphere for predictions?
- spend time thinking and researching of the prompt (what have people already done? what has been found? what is known and not known?)
- look at current submissions for analytics and predictions competition and see what they are doing
- **tracking data** = think differently about statistics that you have ever before
